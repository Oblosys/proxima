\chapter{Presentation Parsing}
LRC just gives string rep.
Ideas on parsing columns:
count column line breaks, look at atrs (difficult in xprez) use text alias '\^' for column that shows a power
This means that similar looking presentations will not parse. 
Full attribute inspection is tough. Maybe some logical constructions (wrong word) such as superscript and subscript as primitives in Xprez, so they can be parsed?

When editing $a^2$ we want to be able to put something in front of the $a$.
