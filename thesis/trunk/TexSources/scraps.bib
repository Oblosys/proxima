Oege de Moor, Kevin Backhouse, S. Doaitse Swierstra:
First-class Attribute Grammars

Haskell/functional representation of attribute grammars on rose trees. Untyped with regard to the grammar of the data and presence of attributes (references to child synthesised require definition of attribute for the child) Attributes (not just attribute values, but attributes, compare to java class instead of object) are first class, allowing for general definitions of copy and chain rules, etc.

not really generic. Can grammar be changed?
very basic presentation specification language. presentations can be stacked vertically in stacks with 3 fields. Alignment is baseline or centerline. Some basic fillers (dots, line, space) are available. Not WYSIWYG: roots are quite different.
