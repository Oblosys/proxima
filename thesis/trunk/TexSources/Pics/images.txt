row.ppt  save as gif, use snagit to crop and convert to png. (ppt save to png gives weird background)
tree: capture image, save as bmp, use paint to finish rectangles
align: capture image, save as bmp, use paint to finish rectangles
frac: capture image, save as png


!!
change align.png.eps to align.bmp.eps
change tree.png.eps to tree.bmp.eps








Visio drawings:
save as Intermediate\*.wmf         (only selected part of drawing is saved)
Open Coreldraw, drop wmf images on it, and export as Eps\*.eps

other methods often cause Coreldraw to crash on opening the file.


Problem. Coreldraws EPS is incorrect. Usually pictures get an extra page.

If latex cannot import the picture, try dragging the file in a new empty Coreldraw document, selecting it, and export selected only.
