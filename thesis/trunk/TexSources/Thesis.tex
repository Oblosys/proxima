Urgent problems:
- direct/indirect editing? direct interpretation in editmodel is op->op without applying. However, directly editing a level is applying.

General TODOs
* Fix math fonts.
* Sentence case for titles?
* check labeling of sections, mayba add chapter to labels (eg. now {sect:conclusions} might be used several times)

*map to/onto?

* change bitmap to image/oid
* explain Parsing/Structure recognizing model somewhere
* define term presentation-oriented somewhere
* mention that doc-oriented is always easy. Even for a syn dir editor, the hard bits are in pointing, which is a pres-oriented op.
* stress that document is internal data structure and not what people usually think (eg. something coming out of a printer) . Perhaps even repeat this a few times.

* Duplicate parser does not seem that complicated!


NOTES
Screen width similar to latex output width:
iii                                                                                                                       

presentation oriented editing is done at layout. 
would be nice to call it presentation. However:
enr.doc --- present -> presentation. level gets name from producing function. 


"higher" is used instead of "upper", because higher level is Level^{High}
upper level is Level_{High} is bit strange, and Level_{Up} does not make sense.








* Order of chapters: layered, single  or single, layered?
* layers, single. PROBLEM edit and diff model must be explained, and is typical single layer stuff
                         GOOD: edit process is already explained before single
                         
* single, layers. PROBLEM assumes edit ops in and out
                                        edit process not explained
                         GOOD: Final bits of layered can give the complete thing, including one layer
                                    edit/diff stuff explained.

single, layers: probably the best choice. edit model is already a bit explained previously. and one of the reasons for edit ops instead of levels is that single layer needs this.
