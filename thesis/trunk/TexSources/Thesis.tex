IMPORTANT
incrementality vs reuse? check what Proxima really does.

Urgent problems:
presentation/rendering image?  mention that lower layers are fixed and hence presentation often used for rendering

General TODOs
* Check for important bits:
* - from CVS: Ch_EditModel.tex, Ch_LayeredArchs.tex, Ch_SingleLayerOld.tex,  and Paper_LayeredArchs.tex  
* - Somewhere.tex, and other old documents

* Extra presentation state and extra interpr. state   versus presentation extra state and interpretation extra state?
* british american  i.e. has , in American english.    is ize possible in british english? If so switch to Br.

* Fix math fonts.

* explain Parsing/Structure recognizing model somewhere
* mention that doc-oriented is always easy. Even for a syn dir editor, the hard bits are in pointing, which is a pres-oriented op.
* stress that document is internal data structure and not what people usually think (eg. something coming out of a printer) . Perhaps even repeat this a few times.


NOTES
Screen width similar to latex output width:
iii                                                                                                                       

presentation oriented editing is done at layout. 
would be nice to call it presentation. However:
enr.doc --- present -> presentation. level gets name from producing function. 


"higher" is used instead of "upper", because higher level is Level^{High}
upper level is Level_{High} is bit strange, and Level_{Up} does not make sense.








* Order of chapters: layered, single  or single, layered?
* layers, single. PROBLEM edit and diff model must be explained, and is typical single layer stuff
                         GOOD: editing process is already explained before single
                         
* single, layers. PROBLEM assumes edit ops in and out
                                        editing process not explained
                         GOOD: Final bits of layered can give the complete thing, including one layer
                                    edit/diff stuff explained.

single, layers: probably the best choice. edit model is already a bit explained previously. and one of the reasons for edit ops instead of levels is that single layer needs this.
