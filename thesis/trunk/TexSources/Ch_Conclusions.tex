\chapter{Conclusions and further research}
\label{chap:conclusions}


%What we did.
Showed why structure eds ar not as generally applicable and popular.

Layered editor architecture that allows mix between pres and doc oriented.

A formal spec. Declarative presentation formalism with abstraction, etc.

Architecture described as part of own program

Language. 


\subsection{Further research}

*incrementality
apply know techniques.?
Proxima keeps track of everything, expensive. However, also good for finding differences. Even simple techniques of diffing big difference.

*automatic interpretation for evaluation and other thing.
important for eval and pres layers. Maybe not fully automatic. but auto for simple and user-specified only for harder bits

* specification
specification
spec for extra state. more examples
spec. for duplicates

Prototype:
evaluation layer. also more language support
enhance presentation language.
Lots of libraries

\subsection{Final remarks}

% 
Rather than simple spec for fast parsing and safe and simple editor. Proxima allows both parser and pres. Result may crash, but in practice easy to make good editor. 

%Why proxima is useful (check with introduction)
Advantages of this way of building editors.
*not a replacement of big ones (word, powerpoint, etc)
*Rapid development
*Good support for editing own datatypes.
*Mixing different editors easy



Prototype seems to work already. pres lang powerful enough. extra state useful. 



Shown that it is possible to provide a good modeless integration of pres oriented and doc oriented editing while still having a strong pres and comp facility. ES. Structure editors may lose their negative image. 

%Interesting problems?? table formatting, generalized paste, etc.
