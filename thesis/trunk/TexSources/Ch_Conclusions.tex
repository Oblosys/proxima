%What we did.
Layered editor architecture that allows mix between pres and doc oriented
Declarative presentation formalism with abstraction, etc.
Architecture described as part of own program

%Why proxima is useful (check with introduction)
Advantages of this way of building editors.
*not a replacement of big ones (word, powerpoint, etc)
*Rapid development
*Good support for editing own datatypes.
*Mixing different editors easy

What we still need to do: gliding scale

specification
spec for extra state. more examples
spec. for duplicates
incrementality

related: automatic interpretation for evaluation and other thing.

Architecture:
evaluation layer. also more language support

Implementation
apply know techniques.?
Proxima keeps track of everything, expensive. However, also good for finding differences. Even simple techniques of diffing big difference.

enhance presentation language.

Prototype seems to work already. pres lang powerful enough. extra state useful. 



Interesting problems?? table formatting, generalized paste, etc.
