------------------------ Thesis: annotated bibtex file

TODO 
ASK: how to get "et al." for long list of authors?

Weird: "translated by" is converted, so we get: t. b. E. V. M. V. Quint
Maybe use different bibliography style?

LATER: check if AG manual is tech report

A more general form of paste. Documents that have the same structure are matched. Also when the source type appears somewhere in the destination type, paste succeeds ((Section (Paragraph str)) can be pasted in (Chapter (Section (Paragraph str))))) Finally,  also when source is a cluster of target, paste can succeed. Implemented in Grif editor. Trees are represented using Dyck words.

Galley approach to formatting. Galleys are like attributes that flow through the document until they find their target. They can be used to generate footnotes, tables of content, references, etc. Quite difficult to understand.

Primitives do not seem very compositional: row [Big, col[vLine, small, vLine]] does not distribute space over lines nicely.

Differencing used to optimize imperative programs, by replacing updates to freevars x1,...,xn in E(x1,...,xn) to updates on incremental E, and using that E instead of recomputing it every time. In proxima, we have doc = doc0; loop { rend = pres doc; doc = deltadoc doc; }
is it possible to do:
doc = doc0; rend = pres doc;
loop { doc = deltadoc doc; deltarendering = ..deltadoc ..; rendering = deltarendering rendering}
?
