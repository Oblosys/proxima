Binaries, lvm files, and images are currently stored in test directory. This way, the binary distribution can have everything in one directory and does not need to add anything to the path.

Future structure:

bin
test
include

But then, if proxima is started from test, it needs to access the binary+dlls, which are in bin, so that bin to be added to the path.

And if proxima is started from bin, it needs the helium file in test, and hence needs to change the current directory.

This can all wait until Proxima has a more mature installation, with path, environment vars, etc.
