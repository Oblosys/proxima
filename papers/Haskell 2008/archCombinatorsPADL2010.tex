\begin{abstract}
We define a domain specific embedded language in Haskell for describing
layered software architectures which maintain bidirectional dependencies. By using a typed programming
language to describe the architecture, the correct composition of its components
is guaranteed by the type checker of the language. Because, contrary to the situation with typical Architecture Description Languages, the
description is part of the implementation they are guaranteed to comply with each other.

\section{Introduction}\label{sect:introduction}

In their survey~\cite{medvidovic00ADLs} of architecture description languages (ADL), three essential components of an architecture description are identified: a description of the (interface of the) \emph{components}, a description of the \emph{connectors}, and a description of the architectural \emph{configuration}. They claim that the focus on conceptual architecture and explicit treatment of connectors as first-class entities differentiate architecture description languages from, amongst others, programming languages. We claim the opposite, and show how a \emph{collection of Haskell functions} can be combined into a component, how the \emph{parameter and result types} of these functions represent the connectors, and how configurations can be described by Haskell expressions built with the use of \emph{architectural combinators}. We substantiate our claim by developing a set of Haskell combinators for describing architectures of layered systems. Although designed with a layered editor in mind, we claim this approach to be applicable to many kinds of architectures. The combinators have been successfully used in the implementation of the generic editor Proxima~\cite{Schrage04Proxima}.

Describing an architecture in an real programming language not only makes it possible to describe the interfaces of the components of the system, and how they are to be composed, but also enables us to smoothly extend this high-level description into a real implementation, without having to maintain several views on our system, with all its problems of diverging versions. Because the architecture description in Haskell is a program in itself, the system can be instantiated by providing implementations for each of the components. By embedding our architecture description language~\cite{hudak98DSLs} inside a general purpose programming language,we can reuse the syntax, semantics, implementation code, software tools, as well as the look-and-feel. Besides this we can easily combine the language with other embedded languages in the same program.

\sds{add summary}
% In this paper we give three implementation models for layered architectures. First, in Section~\ref{sect:simpleEditor}, we introduce a simplified layered editor architecture and, in section~\ref{sect:layerInHaskell}, explore how its main components can be modeled in Haskell. Then we proceed to connect the components. In Section~\ref{sect:simple} the connection is straightforward, with little abstraction. This is used as a basis in Section~\ref{sect:ncp} as a base to develop a more abstract combinator implementation that uses nested pairs. In Section~\ref{sect:hidden}, we present another set of combinators, which employ a form of state hiding to improve on the previous set. Section~\ref{sect:lib} develops a small generic library for building the architecture-specific combinators of Section~\ref{sect:hidden}. The combinators from this section require two minimal function definitions for instantiating a specific architecture. In Section~\ref{sect:typeClass}, we exploit the type system to automatically provide these definitions, based solely on the types of the layer interface. Section~\ref{sect:proxima} shows how the architecture combinators are used to describe (and implement) the architecture of the Proxima editor. And, finally, Section~\ref{sect:conclusions} discusses future work and concludes.
			
			
			
\section{A simple editor}\label{sect:simpleEditor}

The architecture description combinators in this paper have been designed for the generic presentation-oriented structure editor Proxima. Proxima supports editing on the document structure as well as on its presentation, which has given rise to its layered architecture. A typical feature of the architecture is that each layer maintains its own local state, which is used to store information that does not have a logical place on the other layers. Examples are white space, visibility toggles, alignment information, formattig directives, and unfolding status. 

Because of the complexity of the actual Proxima architecture, we introduce a simple layered architecture for a presentation-oriented editor to explain the architecture description methods. Although the architecture is simple, it contains the essential features of the Proxima architecture. In Figure \ref{explicit} we show the flow of data in a typical Proxima implementatation. On the top left we see the input of type \p{doc}, which is mapped by a sequence of \p{present} functions onto a presentation \p{pres3}. This presentation is shown on the screen, after which the user inputs a gesture \p{gest3}, which is mapped back by a sequence of \p{interpret} functions onto an updated document \p{update}. At each level we see state information (for the \p{interpret} function typically also containing a \p{map} to keep track of where things end up on the screen), being passed on horizontally. The states at each level resulting from the \p{interpret} functions are used in the next editing cycle, and so are fed back at the left of the picture.

\section{A Layer in Haskell} \label{sect:layerInHaskell}
A Proxima layer can be seen as an architectural component, something typically represented as a box with connectors in a graphical architecture description language. We will compose the box out of functions, and the arguments and results of these function will constitue the connectors. In our editor example a layer first ``communicates'' by accepting a document to be presented, internally maps this documents onto something which is presented at an output port connected to the lower layer while updating its internal state, next accepts a gesture from the lower layer, and presents an updated document to the layer above, possibly again updating its internal state. So besides having the connector types following from the types of the arguments and results of the internal functions, we also have a ``protocol'', i.e. an order in which the communication takes place at the connectors. 
If we capture this protocol of a Proxima layer in a type we get (forced to use a \p{newtype} since Haskell does not allow recursive types):

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype Layer doc pres gest upd = 
          Layer ( doc -> ( pres, ( gest -> ( upd , 
          Layer doc pres gest upd))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Note that the type of the internal state, which is irrelevant from an architectural point of view, is invisible from this type.


%  \p{lift} converts  a \p{Simple} layer to a hidden-parameter layer of type \p{Layer}, and \p{combine} combines two layers of type \p{Layer}. Both combinators in this section are specific to the \p{Simple} type. In the next section, we define a library to construct \p{lift} and \p{combine} for arbitrary layers.


% \head{Definition of \p{lift}}

% The combinator \p{lift} takes a \p{Simple} layer and returns a \p{Layer}:

% \begin{small}
% \begin{verbatim}
% lift :: Simple state map doc pres gest upd ->
%         state -> Layer doc pres gest upd
% lift simple state = presStep state 
%  where presStep state = Layer $
%          \doc ->  let (pres, (map,state)) = 
%                         present simple state doc                                         
%                   in  (pres, intrStep (map,state))
%        intrStep (map,state) =
%          \gest -> let (upd, state') = 
%                         interpret simple (map,state) gest                     
%                   in  (upd, presStep state')
% \end{verbatim}%$
% \end{small}
% %\marginpar{state -> init omgedoopt}

% Besides \p{layer}, \p{lift} gets a second parameter, \p{init}, which is the initial value of the horizontal parameter. The data flow pattern of the horizontal parameters is encoded entirely in the definition of \p{lift}. Moreover, the \p{state} type is not visible in the result of \p{lift}. Thus, once the initial horizontal state is passed to the lifted layer, it is no longer visible outside this layer; the \p{lift} combinator takes care of passing around the horizontal parameters between the layer functions, and also to the next edit cycle. 


% \head{Definition of \p{combine}}
 To combine layers, we define a combinator \p{combine}, which gets two layers as arguments: a higher layer and a lower layer. The type of \p{combine} is:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
combine :: Layer high med emed ehigh -> Layer med low elow emed -> 
           Layer high low elow ehigh
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The reason for the order of the type variables is that for each pair of variables, the first type is an argument type and the second type  a result type. Hence, the first step in the combined layer is a function \p{high -> low}, which is the composition of a function \p{high -> med} in the higher layer and a function \p{med -> low} in the lower. On the other hand, the second step goes upward.  Thus, the function \p{elow -> ehigh} in the combined layer is the reverse composition of functions \p{elow -> emed} and \p{emed -> ehigh} in the higher and lower layers
  
The implementation of combine is a straightforward --completely controlled by the types-- plumbing to get the parameters at the right places. The direction of the vertical parameters is encoded in the definition of \p{combine}. 

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
combine (Layer upr) (Layer lwr) = Layer $ exec upr lwr
 where exec upr lwr =  \high -> let (med, uprIntr) = upr high
                                    (low, lwrIntr) = lwr med
                                in  (low, 
                       \elow -> let (emed, lwr)  = lwrIntr elow
                                    (ehigh, upr) = uprIntr emed
                                in  (ehigh, exec upr lwr)
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

The edit loop of the simple editor uses a combined component by following its presented \p{Layer} protocol:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
editLoop (Layer presentStep) doc = 
 do { let (pres , interpretStep) = presentStep doc    
    ; showRendering pres
    ; gesture <- getGesture    
    ; let (update, presentStep') = interpretStep gesture    
    ; let doc' = updateDocument update doc    
    ; editLoop presentStep' doc'
    }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

% In the \p{main} function, the combined layer is created by lifting the layers together with their initial states and using \p{combine} to put them together.

% \begin{small}
% \begin{verbatim}
% main layer1 layer2 layer3) =
%  do { (init1, init2, init3) <- initStates
%     ; doc <- initDoc 
%     ; let layers = lift layer1 init1 `combine` 
%                    lift layer2 init2 `combine`
%                    lift layer3 init3
%     ; editLoop layers doc
%     }
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{small}

% \head{Conclusions}

% The hidden-parameter model hides the data flow of the horizontal parameters from the main loop of the system. Furthermore, the types of the horizontal parameters, as well as the intermediate vertical parameters, are hidden from the type of the composed layer. Thus, both horizontal and vertical data flow are made more transparent. 														

\section{Developing a library for architecture descriptions} \label{sect:lib}

In this section, we develop a small library for constructing \p{lift} and \p{combine} combinators for layered architectures having an arbitrary number of layer functions. We refer to these combinators as {\em meta combinators} because they are used to construct combinators.

The \p{lift} and \p{combine} combinators from the previous section are just one case of a layered architecture: a layer with two layer functions and hence two {\em step}s. Even though the combinators are straightforward, some code is duplicated, and small errors are easily made. Therefore, instead of a guideline on how to write \p{lift} and \p{combine} by hand, we prefer a small library of meta combinators for constructing these combinators. A further  advantage of having  a meta-combinator library is that instead of explicitly encoding the direction for each of the steps in the \p{combine} function, we can use the name of the meta combinator to reflect the direction in which the data flows (like with the \text{composeUp$/$Down} functions from the nested pairs method in Section~\ref{sect:ncp}).

Looking at the definitions of \p{lift} and \p{combine} in the previous section, we see that they both consist of two parts: one for each step in the layer. Both functions define a local function for each of the layer functions in the layer. In both \p{lift} and \p{combine} for the \p{Simple} layer type, these local functions are called \p{presStep} and \p{intrStep}. 

We derive the meta combinators by starting with the combinators from the previous section and gradually factoring out all step-specific aspects. We end with a combinator that is constructed out of a collection of simple building blocks (or meta combinators). 
\subsection{Type definitions} \label{subsecttypedef}

In the \p{Layer} type introduced in the previous section, the fact that we are dealing with two steps is explicitly encoded in the type. When dealing with more step-functions in a layer this type will get even more complicated. Since we do not want to ask from the user of the library to write  down such types explicitly, we start out by looking for a way of constructing such complicated types out of types which describe just a single step-function.
\ec

The \p{Layer} type poses a problem if we want to construct a library for building \p{lift} and \p{combine} functions, since somehow its constructors need to be added to and removed by the combinators. One solution is to create a type class for the constructor and deconstructor functions, but this complicates the types and requires a user to provide an instance of this class. Therefore, we introduce a compositional representation of a layer type that makes use of simple types defined in the library.

If we inspect the \p{Layer} type from the Section~\ref{sect:hidden}, we see it is made up of two steps of the form \p{vArg -> (vRes, ...)}. We  capture this in the following type:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype Step a b ns = Step (a -> (b, ns))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\bc
Using GADT's one might even make the fact that a step function should be seen as function by using the following formulation:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype Step :: * -> * -> * where Step :: (a -> (b, ns)) -> Step (a -> b) ns
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
\ec

In order to compose steps, we define an infix, right-associative, type constructor \p{(:.:)}.
The reason for right associativity will become apparent in Section~\ref{subsect:liftDerivation}.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
infixr :.:
newtype (:.:) f g ns  = Comp (f (g ns))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

We also define a \p{NilStep} as the starting point for a series of compositions:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype NilStep t = NilStep t
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Now, for example, we can encode the type \p{Doc -> (Pres, Gest -> (Upd, next))} as
\p{(Step Doc Pres :.: Step Gest Upd :.: NilStep) next}. To encode the feedback loop, we introduce a fixed-point type \p{Fix}:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

With these type combinators, we can now express \p{Layer} in a compositional and point-free way:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
type Layer doc pers gest upd = Fix (Step doc pres :.: Step gest upd :.: NilStep)
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Because \p{Step}, \p{NilStep}, and \p{:.:}  appear partially parameterized in the layer type, and \p{Fix} is recursive, all three types need to be introduced using \p{newtype} definitions. Hence, instead of having a single \p{Layer} constructor, \p{lift} and \p{combine} will be littered with constructors. This is not a problem, however, since the combinators we will derive in the next subsections take care of adding and removing these constructors.

The reason why we have an explicit \p{NilStep} with yet another constructor is that it causes the number of occurrences (\p{:.:}) to be the same as the number of steps, which will facilitate the removal of \p{Comp} constructors. Furthermore, as we will see in Section~\ref{sect:typeClass}, the \p{NilStep} will also provide a base for recursive instances, preventing overlapping instances.


%																
\subsection{Derivation for \p{lift}}\label{subsect:liftDerivation}

First we develop a meta combinator for the \p{lift} function. We start with the code for \p{lift} for a layer with two steps from Section~\ref{sect:hidden}. If we rename several variables and adapt the code for the new constructor-rich representation of the \p{Layer} type, we get:


% from Derivation.hs (remove numbers of lift and combine in source file)
\begin{small} %lift0
\begin{verbatim}
lift simple state = step1 state 
 where step1 hArg = Fix . Comp . Step $
         \vArg -> mapSnd step2 (present simple hArg vArg)
       step2 hArg = Comp . Step $
         \vArg -> mapSns lNilStep (interpret simple hArg vArg)
       lNilStep hRes = NilStep $ step1 hRes
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

The definitions of the local functions \p{step1} and \p{step2} contain mutually-recursive references, thus hard-coding their position in the sequence of steps. We eliminate this positional information in the definitions by supplying the next step as a parameter to each function. The \p{lNilStep} no longer needs to be a local function.

     
\begin{small} % lift1
\begin{verbatim}
lift :: Simple state map doc pres gest upd -> state -> Layer doc pres gest upd
lift simple state =  
  step1 (step2 (lNilStep (lift simple))) state
 where step1 next hArg = Fix . Comp . Step $
         \vArg -> mapSnd next (present simple hArg vArg)
       step2 next hArg = Comp . Step $
         \vArg -> mapSnd next (interpret simple hArg vArg)

lNilStep next hRes = NilStep $ next hRes
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

Next we  capture the \p{Comp} and \p{Step} constructors and the lambda expression with the function \p{liftStep}. Here, it becomes apparent why composition is right associative, since each step has both a\p{Comp} constructor and a \p{Step} constructor. If composition were left-associative, the \p{Comp} constructors would end up between the \p{Fix} and \p{Step} constructors, and it would be harder to capture the pattern.

\begin{small} % lift2
\begin{verbatim}
liftStep f next horArgs = Comp . Step $ mapSnd next .(f horArgs)
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

\noindent leading to the new definition of \p{lift}:

\begin{small} % lift2
\begin{verbatim}
lift simple state = Fix $ step1 (step2 (lNilStep (lift simple))) state
 where step1 next hArg = liftStep (present simple)   next hArg
       step2 next hArg = liftStep (interpret simple) next hArg 
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}



If we drop the \p{state} parameter on the first two lines and rewrite the function application as a composition, we get:
\
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
lift layer = (step1 . step2 . lNilStep) (lift layer)
  ...
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent Capturing the recursion pattern with the \p{fix} combinator:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
fix a = let fixa = a fixa in  fixa
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

we get our next version of \p{lift}:

\begin{small} % lift4
\begin{verbatim}
lift simple = fix (Fix. step1 . step2 . lNilStep)
 where step1 next hArg = liftStep (present simple) next hArg
       step2 next hArg = liftStep (interpret simple) next hArg
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}%$


Regardless the number of steps, there will only be one \p{Fix} constructor (in contrast to the number of \p{Comp} and \p{Step} constructors, which are equal to the number of steps). Hence, we can define a function \p{lfix} to add this constructor. The function \p{lfix} also composes the \p{lNilStep} with the steps. 

\begin{small}% lift5
\begin{verbatim}
lfix f = fix f' where f' n = Fix . (f . lNilStep) n
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}


\begin{small}% lift5
\begin{verbatim}
lift simple = lfix (step1 . step2)
 where step1 next hArg = 
         liftStep (present simple) next hArg
       step2 next hArg = 
         liftStep (interpret simple) next hArg
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Now we got rid of the all the constructors in the local step definitions, we can drop the \p{next} and \p{args} parameters and give a point-free definition:

\begin{small} % lift
\begin{verbatim}
lift :: Simple state map doc pres gest upd ->
        state -> Layer doc pres gest upd
lift simple = lfix $ liftStep (present simple) 
                   . liftStep (interpret simple)
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}


\head{\p{liftStep} works for an arbitrary number of steps}

For an $n$-step layer, the definition of \p{lift} (using the method from Section~\ref{sect:hidden}) has $n$ local step functions, each  containing a reference to the next. \bc \note{mention that the last one refers to the first?} \ec For such a layer, we can perform exactly the same steps as for the 2-step \p{lift}. The resulting \p{lift} contains a composition of $n$ \p{liftStep} applications. If we denote the step type constructors by \p{Step$_i$} and the layer functions by \p{layerFn$_i$}, we get:

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt lift layer = } \= {\tt lfix \$ liftStep (layerFn$_1$ layer)} \\
                    \>       \dots \\
                    \> {\tt .~~~~~~liftStep (layerFn$_n$ layer)}\\
\end{tabbing}%$
\end{small}

%Thus, we can use \p{liftStep} to define the \p{lift} combinator for a layer with any number of layer functions.


%																
\subsection{Derivation for \p{combine}} \label{subsubsectcombine}


The derivation of the meta combinators for \p{combine} is largely similar to the derivation for \p{lift}. We again start with the original definition of \p{combine} for a two-step layer, adapt it to the new \p{Layer} type and rename several variables:

\begin{small} % combine0
\begin{verbatim}
combine upr lwr = step1 upr lwr
 where step1 (Fix (Comp (Step upr))) 
             (Fix (Comp (Step lwr))) = 
         Fix . Comp . Step $ 
         \high -> let (med, uprIntr) = upr high
                      (low, lwrIntr) = lwr med
                  in  (low, step2 uprIntr lwrIntr)
       step2 (Comp (Step upr)) (Comp (Step lwr)) = 
         Comp . Step $
         \low -> let (med, lwrPres) = lwr low
                     (high, uprPres) = upr med
                 in  (high, cNilStep uprPres lwrPres)
       cNilStep (NilStep u) (NilStep l) = 
         NilStep $ step1 u l 
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

The explicit mutual recursion in the local functions is removed by passing the next step as a parameter, and rewriting the whole function as a fixed point. The \p{cNilStep} becomes a top-level function.

\begin{small} %combine2
\begin{verbatim}
combine upr lwr = fix (step1 . step2 . cNilStep) upr lwr
 where step1 next (Fix (Comp (Step upr))) 
                  (Fix (Comp (Step lwr))) = 
         Fix . Comp . Step $ 
         \high -> let (med, uprIntr) = upr high
                      (low, lwrIntr) = lwr med
                  in  (low, next uprIntr lwrIntr)
       step2 next (Comp (Step upr)) (Comp ( Step lwr)) = 
         Comp . Step $
         \low -> let (med, lwrPres) = lwr low
                     (high, uprPres) = upr med
                 in  (high, next uprPres lwrPres)

cNilStep next (NilStep u) (NilStep l) = 
  NilStep $ next u l
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

Without the explicit recursive calls, we can capture the vertical data flow patterns with two functions \p{combineStepDown} and \p{combineStepUp}:

\begin{small} 
\begin{verbatim}
combineStepDown :: (f x -> g y -> h ns) -> 
                   (Step a b :.: f) x -> 
                   (Step b c :.: g) y -> 
                   (Step a c :.: h) ns
combineStepDown next (Comp (Step upper)) 
                     (Comp (Step lower)) = Comp . Step $
  \h -> let (m ,upperf) = upper h
            (l, lowerf) = lower m
        in  (l, next upperf lowerf)   

combineStepUp :: (f x -> g y -> h ns) ->
                 (Step b c :.: f) x ->
                 (Step a b :.: g) y ->
                 (Step a c :.: h) ns
combineStepUp next (Comp (Step upper)) 
                   (Comp (Step lower)) = Comp . Step $ 
  \l -> let (m, lowerf) = lower l
            (h, upperf) = upper m
        in  (h, next upperf lowerf)   
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

%Geldt ook combineStepUp next f g = combineStepDown (flip next) g f?
If we use these two functions, and drop the parameters to \p{step2}, we get:

\begin{small}%combine3
\begin{verbatim}
combine upr lwr = fix (step1 . step2 . cNilStep) upr lwr
 where step1 next (Fix upr) (Fix lwr) = 
         Fix $ combineStepDown next upr lwr
       step2 = combineStepUp
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

The second step is now simply a \p{combineStepUp}, but the first step still contains a \p{Fix} constructor. In order to get rid of it, we first rewrite \p{combine} to make the pattern more apparent:

\begin{small}%combine4
\begin{verbatim}
combine = fix (\n (Fix u) (Fix l) -> 
  Fix $ (step1 . combineStepUp . cNilStep) n u l) 
 where step1 next upr lwr = 
         combineStepDown next upr lwr
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}%$

Now we can define a function \p{cfix} that pattern matches on the arguments and adds a \p{Fix} to the result. Similar to \p{lfix}, it also adds the \p{cNilStep}.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
cfix f = fix f' 
 where f' n (Fix u) (Fix l) = Fix $ (f . cNilStep) n u l
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

which leaves us with:

\begin{small}% combine5
\begin{verbatim}
combine upr lwr = cfix (step1 . step2) upr lwr
 where step1 next upr lwr = 
         combineStepDown next upr lwr
       step2 = combineStepUp
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}


Now, we can drop the parameters and replace to \p{step1} and \p{step2} by \p{combineStepDown} and \p{combineStepDown}. Thus, the final version of \p{combine} reads

\begin{small}%combine
\begin{verbatim}
combine :: Layer high med emed ehigh ->
           Layer med low elow emed -> 
           Layer high low elow ehigh
combine = cfix (combineStepDown . combineStepUp)
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}


Similar to \p{liftStep}, \p{combineStepDown} and \p{combineStepUp} do not depend on the number of steps. Hence, they can be used to construct \p{combine} for layers with an arbitrary number of layer functions.


\head{Simple editor}

The \p{main} function for the simple editor is the same as in Section~\ref{sect:hidden}. Only the \p{editLoop} function has a couple of changes to account for the new constructors. To make the code more symmetric, we define deconstructor functions \p{unStep :: (Step a r :.: g) t -> a -> (r, (g t))} and \p{unNil} (which is the selector function of \p{NilStep}, when declared as a record.)

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
unStep (Comp (Step step)) = step
unNil (NilStep step) = step

editLoop (Fix presentStep) doc = 
 do { let (pres , interpretStep) = 
            unStep presentStep $ doc
    
    ; showRendering pres
    ; gesture <- getGesture
    
    ; let (update, presentStep') =
            unStep interpretStep $ gesture
    
    ; let doc' = updateDocument update doc
    ; 
    ; editLoop (unNil presentStep') doc'
    }
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

\subsection{Adding a monad}


The final modification we make to the library is to add a monad, in order to allow layer functions to perform IO operations. The type \p{LayerFn} is extended with an extra type variable \p{m} for the monad.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
type LayerFn m horArgs vertArg horRess vertRes =
       horArgs -> vertArg -> m (vertRes, horRess)
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Consequentially, the \p{Step} type is also modified to account for the monadic result:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype Step a b m ns = Step (a -> m (b, ns))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

At composition, the monad is passed to both arguments:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype (:.:) f g m ns  = Comp (f m (g m ns))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The \p{NilStep} does not actually use the monad argument:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype NilStep m t = NilStep t
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

For the fixed point, we introduce a type synonym \p{FixM}, which passes the monad to its type-function argument, and applies \p{Fix} to the result.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
type FixM m f = Fix (f m)
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The monadic version of the other code is largely similar to the non-monadic version. Basically, each let expression of the form\\

\noindent
\p{\small let x$_1$ = $exp_1$; \dots ; x$_n$ = $exp_n$ in ($hRes$,$vRes$)}\\

is replaced by a monadic statement\\

\noindent
\p{\small do \{ x$_1$ <- $exp_1$; \dots ; x$_n$ <- $exp_n$; return ($hRes$,$vRes$) \}}\\

Furthermore, the type signatures for the pairs of horizontal and vertical results \p{($hRes$, $vRes$)} become \p{m ($hRes$, $vRes$)}. Because of the similarity between the two libraries, we only show the monadic \p{liftStep}:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
liftStep :: (hArg -> vArg-> m (vRes, hRes)) -> 
            (hRes -> ns) -> hArg -> Step vArg vRes ns
liftStep f next horArgs = Step $ 
  \vArg -> do { (vertRes, horRes) <- f horArgs vArg
              ; return (vertRes, next horRes)
              }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}%$

The functions \p{lfix}, \p{lcomp}, \p{cfix}, and \p{ccomp} are independent of the monad and are the same for both versions of the library.

\end{footnotesize}\caption{Final meta-combinator library}\label{fig:metacombinators} 
\end{center}
\end{small}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:metacombinators} contains the final monadic library. In order to describe and implement an architecture, we need to provide a \p{Layer} type, and definitions of \p{lift} and \p{combine}. We give a general description of these definitions.


\head{General use} 


The general case that we consider is a layer with $n$ layer functions. The record type \p{TheLayer m h$_1$ \dots ~h$_m$ a$_1$ r$_1$ a$_2$ r$_2$ \dots ~a$_n$ r$_n$} contains the layer functions. The variable \p{m} is the monad, variables \p{h$_i$} are the types that appear in the horizontal parameters of the layer, and the \p{a$_i$} and \p{r$_i$} are the types of the vertical arguments and results. 

Because the types of the horizontal parameters are not necessarily single \p{h$_i$} variables, but tuples of these variables, we denote the horizontal parameters by $horArgs_i$ and $horRess_i$. As an example, consider the type \p{Simple}. Its horizontal  type variables are \p{map} and \p{state}, but the types of the horizontal parameters are \p{state} and \p{(map, state)}. 

In general, the definition of \p{TheLayer} has this form:

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt da}\={\tt ta}\\
\> {\tt Th}\={\tt eLayer~m h$_1$ \dots ~h$_m$ a$_1$ r$_1$ a$_2$ r$_2$ \dots ~a$_n$ r$_n$ = }\\
\> \> {\tt TheLayer~}\={\tt \{~LayerFn$_1$}\verb| :: |{\tt LayerFn~m~}\= {\tt $horArgs_1$ a$_1$}\\
\> \>                \>                                             \> {\tt $horArgs_2$ r$_1$}\\
\>\>\> {\tt , LayerFn$_2$}\verb| :: |{\tt LayerFn~m~}\={\tt $horArgs_2$ a$_2$}\\
\> \>                \>                            \>{\tt $horArgs_3$ r$_2$ \}}\\
\>\>\> {\tt \dots }\\
\>\>\> {\tt , LayerFn$_n$}\verb| :: |{\tt LayerFn~m~}\={\tt $horArgs_{n}$ a$_n$}\\
\> \>                \>                            \>{\tt $horArgs_1$ r$_n$ \}}\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{small}

We assume the layer is normalized, meaning that $horArgs_{1} = horRess_n$ and 
$horArgs_{i+1} = horRess_i$. If the layer is not normalized, a simple wrapper function can be defined to convert the layer to a normalized layer (see Section~\ref{sect:layerInHaskell}). 

\head{Type definitions}

For a layer record as defined above, the type definition for the \p{Layer} type used by the combinators is:

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt ty}\={\tt pe Layer m a$_1$ r$_1$ a$_2$ r$_2$ \dots ~a$_n$ r$_n$ =}\\
        \>{\tt FixM m (Step a$_1$ r$_1$ :.: a$_2$ r$_2$ :.: \dots ~:.: Step a$_n$ r$_n$)}\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{small}


\head{Definition of \p{lift} and \p{combine}} 

The definitions of \p{lift} and \p{combine} are straightforward. For \p{lift}, we need to apply \p{liftStep} to each of the layer functions, compose the steps with \p{lcomp}, and apply \p{lfix} to the composition. 

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt lift}\verb| :: |\={\tt Monad m =>}\\
                     \>{\tt TheLayer m h$_1$ \dots ~h$_m$ a$_1$ r$_1$ \dots ~a$_n$ r$_n$ ->}\\
                     \>{\tt Layer m a$_1$ r$_1$ \dots ~a$_n$ r$_n$}\\
{\tt li}\={\tt ft t}\={\tt heLayer = }\\
\>{\tt lfix \$ liftStep (LayerFn$_1$ theLayer)}\\
\>\verb|     . lift|{\tt Step (LayerFn$_2$ theLayer)}\\
\>{\tt ~~~~~\dots}\\ 
\>\verb|     . lift|{\tt Step (LayerFn$_n$ theLayer)}
\end{tabbing}
\end{small}%$


The \p{combine} combinator consists of $n$ \p{combineStepUp$/$Down} meta combinators, composed with \p{ccomp}, after which \p{cfix} is applied. The direction of the vertical data flow determines the choice between \p{combineStepUp} and \p{combineStepDown} for each step.  The exact type of \p{combine} depends on the direction of the meta combinators and is explained below. 

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt combine}\verb| :: |\={\tt Monad m =>}\\
                        \>{\tt Layer m \dots}\verb| -> |{\tt Layer m \dots}\verb| -> |{\tt Layer m \dots }\\
{\tt co}\={\tt mbine}\={\tt ~= }\\
\>{\tt cfix \$ combineStepUp$/$Down}\\
\>{\tt ~~~~~\dots}\\ 
\>\verb|     . combine|{\tt StepUp$/$Down}\\
\end{tabbing}%$
\end{small}

The type of \p{combine} depends on the direction of the vertical data flow in the layer. Consider the $i$-th pair of  type variables in \p{Layer a$_1$ r$_1$ \dots~a$_n$ r$_n$}. Variable \p{a$_i$} represents the vertical argument of layer function $i$, and \p{r$_i$} the vertical result. If step $i$ is an upward step, the variables at this position in the \p{Layer} types are related as follows in the type signature for \p{combine}:

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt  combine :: }\={\tt Monad m =>}\\
                  \>{\tt Layer \dots~md h \dots}\verb| -> |{\tt Layer \dots~l~md \dots} \verb| ->|\\
                  \>{\tt Layer \dots~l h \dots}\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{small}

On the other hand, for a downward layer function, we have:

\begin{small}
\begin{tabbing}
{\tt  combine :: }\={\tt Monad m =>}\\
                  \>{\tt Layer \dots~h md \dots}\verb| -> |{\tt Layer \dots~md l \dots} \verb| ->|\\
                  \>{\tt Layer \dots~h l \dots}
\end{tabbing}
\end{small}


\subsection{Conclusions} 

The meta combinator library has the advantages of the hidden-parameter solution from Section~\ref{sect:hidden}, but at the same time, it is much easier to describe a specific architecture. The use of meta combinators makes the data flow clearer and reduces the chance of errors in the specification. For a specific architecture, we only need to define a \p{Layer} type, and give simple definitions of \p{lift} and \p{combine}.

\section{Type-class magic} \label{sect:typeClass}

The definitions of \p{lift} and \p{combine} that have to be provided manually for each specific architecture are almost uniquely determined by the layer type, which leads to the question whether we can use type classes to construct generic versions of these functions. Indeed, this turns out to be possible if we encode the direction of each step in its type. In this section, we present the type classes and instances that do the job. For clarity, we use the non-monadic combinators from Section~\ref{sect:lib} as a base.

To encode the direction of a step, we extend the \p{Step} type with a phantom-type variable~\cite{leijen99dsecs}.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
newtype Step dir a b ns = Step (a -> (b, ns))
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Two constructorless types encode the direction.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
data Up 
data Down 
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}



\head{Definition of \p{genericLift}}

A generic version of \p{lift} would take a variable number of layer functions, and returns a layer type . The number of layer functions is determined by the number of steps in the result type (which is determined by the context in which it is used.)

The structure of a generic version of \p{lift} in a pseudo-Haskell language would read:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
genericLift :: 
  lf1 -> .. -> lfn ->
  Fix (Step Up/Down <s1> :.: .. :.: Step Up/Down <sn>)
genericLift = \lf1 .. lfn -> 
              lfix (liftStep lf1 . ..  . liftStep lfn)
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

In this code, we can identify a composition function that takes a varying number of functions (\p{liftStep lf1} to \p{liftStep lfn}) and return a composition. If we assume a function \p{compose}, that takes a representation of the number of steps (denoted by \p{<n>}) followed by \p{n} functions, we can rewrite \p{genericLift} to:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
genericLift = \lf1 .. lfn -> 
  lfix (compose <n> (liftStep lf1) .. (liftStep lfn))
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

% this backslash somehow is not tt
Now, we can identify another pattern \p{ $\mathtt{\backslash}$a1 an -> f (g (h a1) .. (h an))}. Because of the parentheses around \p{g} and its arguments, we cannot simply compose \p{f} and \p{g}. We assume a function \p{app}, which takes the representation of the steps \p{<n>}, and the two functions \p{f} and \p{g}. For \p{h}, \p{app} uses \p{liftStep}, which is not a parameter. If we take \p{f} to be \p{lfix}, and \p{g} to be \p{compose <n>}, we have a new version of \p{genericLift}:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
genericLift = app <n> lfix (compose <n>)
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

The final non-Haskell part in the definition is the \p{<n>} expression. The number of steps is represented by the argument of the \p{Fix} type in the result of \p{genericLift}. Hence, we assume a function \p{resType}, which for functions of type \p{a1 .. an -> Fix (s1 :.: .. :.: sn)} returns \p{steps t} (note that \p{steps} has kind \p{* -> *}). With this last function, the definition of \p{genericLift} is no longer pseudo code, but actual Haskell:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
genericLift = app (resType genericLift) lfix 
                  (compose (resType genericLift))
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

Which leaves us the task of defining the type classes  for constructing the right instances for \p{compose}, \p{app}, and \p{resType}.

For the variable-argument composition \p{compose}, we declare a class \p{Comp} with a single method \p{comp}, which takes a composition type, and a neutral element, and returns a composition function that takes as many arguments as the composition type has steps. The function \p{compose} is simply \p{comp} with \p{id} for the neutral element.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
class Comp (cmp :: * -> *) r c | cmp -> r c where
  comp :: cmp t -> r -> c

instance Comp (NilStep) (b->res) (b->res)  where
  comp cmp r = r  

instance Comp g (a->res) cmp =>
         Comp (f :.: g) (y->res) ((a->y) -> cmp) where
  comp cmp r = \ab -> comp (rightType cmp) (r.ab)

rightType :: (f :.: g) t -> g t
rightType = undefined

compose c = comp c id
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The application function is a bit more complex. The class \p{App} has a method \p{app}, which takes a composition type, and two functions \p{f} and \p{fx}. The result is a function that has the same number of arguments as the composition type has steps, and which applies \p{fx} to each argument, and applies these arguments to the function \p{f}.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
class App (cmp :: * -> *) f fx r | cmp f -> fx r  where
  app :: cmp t -> f -> fx -> r

instance App (NilStep) (a->b) a b  where
  app cmp f a = f a

instance App g (a->b) d e =>
         App (Step dr ar rs :.: g) (a->b) 
              (((hRes -> g ns) -> hArg -> 
                (Step dr vArg vRes :.: g) ns) ->d) 
             (LayerFn hArg vArg hRes vRes ->e) where
  app cmp f fx = \lf -> (app (rightType cmp) f
                             (fx (liftStep lf))) 
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The code for \p{liftStep} is the same as in the previous section. Its type differs slightly due to the direction type variable, but since this is a phantom type, it does not show up in the values. 

The last problem we need to tackle is how to obtain the composition type over which \p{compose} and \p{app} recurse. For this we declare a class \p{ResType} with a method \p{resType}, which yields the result type of its function argument. Since the result of \p{genericLift} is always of type \p{Fix ct}, we can define a base instance for \p{Fix ct}, in which \p{restype} returns \p{ct t}, and a recursive instance for \p{a -> f}, in which \p{restype} returns the result type of \p{f}. Since no values are actually computed here, we can give the method a default implementation of \p{undefined}.


\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
class ResType f res | f -> res where
  resType :: f -> res
  resType = undefined

instance ResType (Fix ct) (ct t)
  
instance ResType f r => ResType (a -> f) r
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}



\head{Definition of \p{genericCombine}}

The situation for \p{genericCombine} is somewhat simpler than for \p{genericLift}, since the function does not have a varying number of arguments. However, unlike \p{genericLift}, the step functions are based on the direction of the step. If we look at \p{genericCombine}, the general structure would be:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
combine :: 
  Fix (Step Up/Down .. :.: .. :.: Step Up/Down .. ) ->
  Fix (Step Up/Down .. :.: .. :.: Step Up/Down .. ) ->
  Fix (Step Up/Down .. :.: .. :.: Step Up/Down .. )
combine = cfix \$ combineStepUp/Down 
                  ...
                . combineStepUp/Down 
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

We assume a function that creates a composition of \p{n} combine steps, where the choice for an upward or a downward step is based on the direction of the respective \p{Step} type in the composition type.


\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
genericCombine = cfix (combineC (resType genericCombine))
\end{verbatim}%$
\end{small}

The type class looks a bit unfriendly due to the presence of the \p{Step} type, which is necessary because of the dependence on the direction.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
class Combine (cmp :: * -> *) t f | cmp t -> f where
  combineC :: cmp t -> f

instance Combine NilStep t ((x -> y -> t) -> 
          (NilStep x) -> (NilStep y) -> NilStep t) where
  combineC _ = \next (NilStep x) (NilStep y) ->
                 NilStep (next x y) 
 
instance (Combine c ct ( (ut -> lt -> ct) ->
                        u ut -> l lt-> c ct) ) =>
         Combine (Step Down a r :.: c) ct
                 ((ut -> lt -> ct) ->
                  (Step Down a m :.: u) ut -> 
                  (Step Down m r :.: l) lt -> 
                  (Step Down a r :.: c) ct) where
  combineC cmp = \next u l ->
    combineStepDown (combineC (rightType cmp) next) u l
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\bc
instance (Combine c ct ( (ut -> lt -> ct) ->
                        u ut -> l lt-> c ct) ) =>
         Combine (Step Up a r :.: c) ct
                 ((ut -> lt -> ct) -> 
                  (Step Up m r :.: u) ut -> 
                  (Step Up a m :.: l) lt -> 
                  (Step Up a r :.: c) ct) where
  combineC cmp = \next f g ->
    combineStepUp (combineC (rightType cmp) next) f g
\ec
There is also an instance for \p{Step Up} but it is very similar to the instance for \p{Step Down}. The only difference is that \p{Down} is replaced by \p{up}, and that the parameter order for the upper and lower arguments  \p{a m} and \p{m r} is replaced by \p{m r} and \p{a m}. Hence, we do not show it here.



\head{Simple editor}


With the two generic functions defined above, it is no longer necessary to manually define a \p{combine} function. For \p{lift}, it still makes sense to define a function that takes a layer as an argument and selects the functions from this layer to pass on to \p{genericLift}.

The required definitions for the simple editor are:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
type Layer dc prs gst upd = 
  Fix (Step Down dc prs :.: Step Up gst upd :.: NilStep)

                
lift :: Simple state map doc pres gest upd ->
               state -> Layer doc pres gest upd
lift smpl = genericLift (present smpl) (interpret smpl)

main layer1 layer2 layer3 =
 do { (init1, init2, init3) <- initStates
    ; doc <- initDoc 

    ; let layers = lift layer1 init1 `genericCombine` 
                   lift layer2 init2 `genericCombine`
                   lift layer3 init3
    ; editLoop layers doc
    }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The code for \p{editLoop} is the same as in Section~\ref{sect:lib}.

The monadic version of the generic combinators is a straightforward extension, but has even more daunting types, so we will not present it here. 

Although type errors become somewhat more complicated because of the overloaded types, the type class solution turns out to be quite useful. The monadic version has been successfully tested in the Proxima generic editor.

\section{The Proxima editor} \label{sect:proxima}


The Proxima editor uses the combinators from Figure~\ref{fig:metacombinators}  for the description of its architecture. The module that contains the architecture description is an part of the implementation of the prototype. 

Although the precise data flow of a Proxima layer is beyond the scope of this paper, we show a general overview in Figure~\ref{proximaDataFlow}. The main difference with a \p{Simple} layer is that instead of mapping one data level onto another, a Proxima layer maps edit operations on a data level onto edit operations on the other level. Hence, each layer must also keep track of the actual data at each level. The edit operations are the deltas in the figure, whereas the data levels are the {\em high} and {\em low} values, which are threaded through the layer and switch between being vertical and horizontal parameters. 


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/LayerDataFlow}
\caption{Data flow in a Proxima layer.} \label{proximaDataFlow}
\end{figure}



\bc
The main difference between a Proxima layer and a \p{Simple} layer is that in Proxima, the data levels are part of the horizontal data flow. The vertical data flow consists of edit operations. Furthermore, the first step in a Proxima layer is \p{interpret} instead of \p{present}.

Note that the identifiers represent values, and not type variables. The dotted arrows outside the layer sketch the data flow of the higher and lower levels in the adjacent layers. Besides the lower-level edit operation $\delta_{Low}$, \p{interpret} gets both levels and a $state$ argument (which is explained below). The result of \p{interpret} is the higher level edit operation $\delta_{High}$, and a new $state'$. Moreover, \p{interpret} returns $low'$, which is the result of applying $\delta_{Low}$ to $Low$. The behavior of \p{present} is symmetrical.

The figure also shows how the higher level is updated by \p{interpret} of layer above, before coming back down as $high'$. Similarly, \p{present} of the layer below updates $low'$ to $low''$. 

The $state$ parameter represents the local state for a layer. It should not be confused with extra state, which is part of the level. Local layer state is information that is needed by a layer, but belongs to the layer rather than to one of the adjacent levels. An example is a reference to a font metrics table in the arrangement layer.

At the top of the combined layers, the document and edit operation resulting from interpretation are passed back as arguments to the presentation step. And at the bottom, an edit gesture from the user must be put into the combined layers combination, and an updated rendering is be shown to the user. 
\ec

The data flow in the figure is encoded in the type definition for a Proxima layer. For the edit operations (the $\delta$'s in Figure~\ref{proximaDataFlow}), we use distinct types for edit operations going up (\p{editH} and \p{editL}) and edit operations going down (\p{editH'} and \p{editL'}). The reason for this distinction is that upward edit operations are often of a different nature than the downward ones. The code below is actual Proxima source code:

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
data Layer m state high low editH editL editH' editL' =
       Layer { interpret ::
                 LayerFn m (state, high) (low, editL)
                           (state, low) (high, editH)
             , present ::
                 LayerFn m (state, low) (high, editH')
                           (state, high) (low, editL')
             }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The \p{Layer} definition is part of the \p{Architecture} module, which imports the modules that define \p{interpret} and \p{present} for each layer. The definitions of the layer type as well as \p{lift} and \p{combine} for Proxima are the same as for the simple editor, except for the fact that \p{present} and \p{interpret} are swapped. The Proxima main edit loop is also virtually the same, except that it consists of more layers than the simple editor.

The architecture combinators enforce a a strict separation between the different layers. In some cases, this . However, in general it leads to a very compositional system in which the data flow is very transparent. The addition of a new layer. Furthermore the strict separation also helped to keep user interface dependent code ... to only a few modules. Hence, adapting the system for a different user interface is not a major operation.

\bl
\o same problem as with type system. Restricting, but enforcess correctness
\o separation, all connections explicit. Very easy to add a new layer. 
\o in contrast to editors in which UI directly updates document.

\bc
The motivation for using Haskell to describe editor architectures has come from the Proxima project. Proxima is a generic incremental XML editor, which is being developed at Utrecht University. The editor is parameterized with a presentation sheet that specifies how a document is presented. Furthermore, it is parameterized with a computation sheet that specifies derived values, such as chapter numbers, or a table of contents. A user can only see and edit the final presentation of the document. Because the mapping of the document on the presentation is a stepwise process, and hence the interpretation*** from edit commands on the presentation to updates on the document as well, Proxima has a layered architecture.

\section{Related work} \label{sect:relatedWork}


The requirements for a DSEL for describing architectures are slightly different from the requirements for more familiar applications of DSELs, such as parsers, pretty printers, etc. The latter are used to write programs that contain many applications of the combinators and that are usually subject to frequent change and frequent use. An architecture description, on the other hand, will typically be a small and rather static entity, because changes to the architecture involve changes to many components of the system. The first association many have with the term ``Architecture Description Language'' is a graphical design environment, in which one can sketch the architecture. Futere work thus incorporates the use of Proxima for bulding such editing environments: the use sees and manipuates a graphical representation, whereas the model is actually a Haskell program. In this research we will build upon work done already in another context: the manipulation of Bayesian networks \cite{schrage05Dazzle}.

\section{Conclusions and future work} \label{sect:conclusions}

The combinators presented in this paper make it possible to specify layered editor architectures in a concise and transparent way. With a small number of definitions, a layered architecture can be described, clearly showing the data flow between the layers. The combinators have been heap profiled to ensure that no memory leaks are present, and have been used to implement the Proxima prototype as well as a database web-interface system.

Because the architecture description language is embedded in the implementation language, the architecture of a system forms part of the implementation of the system. We do not need to translate the architecture to an implementation, and hence, the implementation is guaranteed to comply with the architecture and vice versa.

According to Medvidovic and Taylor~\cite{medvidovic00ADLs}, an architecture description language should describe the components of an architecture, the connectors, and the configuration. For the architecture combinators defined in this paper, we can identify these aspects as follows: the layer functions are the components; \p{lift} and \p{combine} are the connectors; and the applications of \p{lift} and \p{combine} determine the configuration.

In the paper we have assumed that once we call a (combined) step function, the information flows through all the layers. In a real editor this might not always be the case; if the user adds some extra white-space this might be recorded in the state at one of the intermediate levels, upon which the presentation process can be resumed. We can also envision a situation where information flows up and down a few times between two adjacent layers, until a situation is reached in which a change has to be propagated to yet another layer. Note that we actually only require that the upper protocol of a lower layer corresponds to the lower protocol of its upper layer; the updating of the document and providing the gesture at the bottom layer are examples of simple single-step protocols. We foresee however that we might use the type system to describe much more complicated protocols. An open question, and a matter of debate, is whether this should be done by exploiting the Haskell type system further, or whether one should move to more expressive type systems such as found in Agda \cite{norell:thesis}. Only experimenting and comparing solutions can give a definitive answer. Another area of research concerns how dynamic aspects of the architecture, such as invariants and constraints on the data, can be described and, if possible, verified.

The combinator language in this paper is tailored to a specific kind of architectures: those of layered editors. Although we use the term editor in a broad sense, also including spreadsheets, e-mail agents, etc., further research should explore the possibilities of using Haskell to describe other kinds of architectures. For us the experiment to model the structure of the system using Haskell has been a successful experience, and we hope that this paper will inspire others to pursue the approach for different classes of architectures.
