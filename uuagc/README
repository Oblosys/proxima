Please pick the right section in this file for instructions depending on how you optained the uuagc sources.

IMPORTANT: We assume that you have the latest official release of GHC installed together with the accompanying Cabal package. For older GHC installations, rename:
   uuagc.cabal-for-ghc-6.6      to    uuagc.cabal
 or upgrade to at least Cabal-1.2.x


-------------------------------------------
Installing uuagc from a source distribution
-------------------------------------------
Here we assume that you have downloaded the sources from http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/HUT/Download .

    ghc --make Setup.hs -o setup -package Cabal
    ./setup configure
    ./setup build
    ./setup install

  The 1.0 release of Cabal has a bug that prevents
  the installation step from succeeding.
  You may prefer to use the following alternative:

    ./configure
    make build
    make install

-------------------------------
Using the user package database
-------------------------------

  In the case that you registered uulib in your
  user package database you may install uuagc
  thusly:

    ghc --make Setup.hs -o setup -package Cabal
    ./setup configure --user
    ./setup build
    ./setup install

  Or, alternatively:

    ./configure --with-user-pckg
    make build
    make install

---------------------------------------------------------------
Installing uuagc after checking out from the svn respository
---------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that this is only possible if you alreday have a running version of the uuagc on your system. 
This can be downloaded from: http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/HUT/Download

  First execute the steps below:

    autoconf
    ./configure
    make build
    make install
